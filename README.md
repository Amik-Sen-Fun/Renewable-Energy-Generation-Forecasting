# Renewable Energy Generation Forecasting

> Note: This is my first project in the process of learning Data Science. I'll be studying various data science topics and refering to various research papers on the go! 

# Approach

We will be using **XGBoost** for this and try to understand this famous algorithm, that helped win various Kaggel competitions in the past! 

Firstly, XGBoost is the name of a library! For me it was a shocker because I always thought of it as some Algorithm! However, it is not! The algorithm which is implemented with the help of XGBoost is **Gradient Boosted Trees**.

The following is the architecture of a Gradient Boosted Trees:
